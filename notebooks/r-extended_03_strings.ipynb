    "my_text <- \"That evening, at eight-thirty, exquisitely dressed and wearing a large button-hole of Parma violets, Dorian Gray was ushered into Lady Narborough’s drawing-room by bowing servants. His forehead was throbbing with maddened nerves, and he felt wildly excited, but his manner as he bent over his hostess’s hand was as easy and graceful as ever. Perhaps one never seems so much at one’s ease as when one has to play a part. Certainly no one looking at Dorian Gray that night could have believed that he had passed through a tragedy as horrible as any tragedy of our age. Those finely shaped fingers could never have clutched a knife for sin, nor those smiling lips have cried out on God and goodness. He himself could not help wondering at the calm of his demeanour, and for a moment felt keenly the terrible pleasure of a double life. \"\n",

    "\n",
    "In the following, you will create a vector containing the sentences of the texts and then looking up certain words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have the package `stringr` installed and loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assign the following text snippet to an object:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"Themis, who has already been alluded to as the wife of Zeus, was the daughter of Cronus and Rhea, and personified those divine laws of justice and order by means of which the well-being and morality of communities are regulated. She presided over the assemblies of the people and the laws of hospitality.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Convert the text snippet to a vector of senteces.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    a. Split the texts into sentences using `str_split(texts, pattern = \",\")`. Assign to an object (splitting at commas instead of periods).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. Unlist the object to convert to a vector using `unlist()`. Assign to the same or a new object.\n",

    "2. Use `str_subset()` to see extract sentences that contain the name \"Zeus\". "
